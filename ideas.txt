--- CORE ---
1. Train timings
	- Store station names (linear route or graph?)
	- Set trains going back and forth on some particular routes (only one train for linear route)
	- Can calculate timings (Station name and time of arrival/departure) based on above two
	
2. Book ticket
	2.1. User side
		- Search based on starting and ending stations, display available trains and time of arrival/departure
		- Tell how much %age of seats are full for a given train displayed above
	2.2. System side
		- Store user seat no. and time of boarding/unboarding for each train
	2.3 Credentials
		- User will have to enter credentials for booking ticket (Store them in a database(sqlite3 probably) or simply json?)
		- We will accept dummy bank account for transaction (this isn't a banking system!), or just don't ask for transaction
		
3. Cancel ticket

4. Update train positions
	- Maybe we can simulate everything...like in games...but very basic
	- Trains can eventually reach a destination
